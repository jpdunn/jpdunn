### Hey, I'm Josh üëã

I'm a Technical Lead based in Brisbane, Australia. I am heavily focused on .NET Framework and .NET core apps, with Angular and SCSS/LESS front end. Some of my other preferred languages include Java, Objective-C, and Node.JS/TypeScript to name a few.

Want to see what I get up to in my free time? Check out some of my projects.
* [GTA Session Bot](https://github.com/jpdunn/GTA-Session-Bot) - An in-depth project which allows users to create a "private" session in Grand Theft Auto Online and control the entire thing through a Discord bot.
* [Discord Bot Template](https://github.com/jpdunn/Discord-Bot-Template) - A simple Visual Studio template for a Discord.NET bot written in C#.
* [Cache Cleaner](https://github.com/jpdunn/CacheCleaner) - A lightweight Chrome extension which clears your cache upon each page load.


Want to see the things that I'll never have the time to finish? Check out my [playground](https://github.com/jpdunn/Playground).
